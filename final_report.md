## GSoC2025: Enhanced Dual Contouring
I participated in **Google Summer of Code 2025** with [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), where I developed methods for robust manifold isosurface extraction in the `Isosurfacing_3` package.
## Introduction
**Dual Contouring (DC)** is a classical mesh extraction method implemented in CGAL. A key limitation of the standard DC method is that it can generate **nonmanifold surfaces**, leading to topological inconsistencies and computational challenges. The overall objective is to enhance CGAL's dual contouring solver to ensure that the generated surfaces are always **2-manifold**. Several variants have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. Among them, we decided to implement the **Manifold Dual Contouring (MDC)** method introduced by Schaefer, Ju and Warren. 

- In the **uniform voxel grid** setting, MDC reduces to the **Dual Marching Cubes (DMC)** method, which constructs meshes using dual vertices derived from patches in the marching cubes lookup table.  
- In the **adaptive octree** setting, MDC further incorporates **vertex clustering** and a **manifold criterion** to avoid the generation of non-manifold configurations.
  
However, during the implementation, we observed that even MDC does not always guarantee manifold output. For this reason, the project trajectory shifted to focus specifically on **enforcing manifold guarantees in the uniform voxel case**, laying a robust foundation before tackling adaptive refinement. 

The project followed a three-stage roadmap. I began by implementing the classical DMC algorithm as the core pipeline. Building on this foundation, I implemented the **Topologically-Correct Dual Marching Cubes (TMC-DMC)** extension to handle ambiguous cases in the MC lookup table (e.g. MC cases 105). While this step resolves certain nonmanifold configurations introduced by ambiguous cases, it does not by itself ensure global manifoldness. Finally, to resolve remaining nonmanifold features--especially nonmanifold edges--I integrated the method described in [*Resolving Non-Manifoldness on Meshes from Dual Marching Cubes*](https://diglib.eg.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/561b6de0-f239-478a-8ae0-717bb42aec3b/content) (D. Zint, R. Grosso, P. GÃ¼rtler).
